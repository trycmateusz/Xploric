# Xploric - A streaming service for finding new music that also acts as a forum.

A streaming service clone, for saving music that you can discover when fetching random songs from Spotify API.
The design is original and all the code is written by me.

## Functionality

Here's a list of all the different things you can do on this site:

### User

- creating and customizing your user profile
- creating playlists to save music
- editing playlists (as well as managing its songs ect.)
- ability to comment other's playlist
- defining your 'publicity' options to determine if you want other users to be able to look through your profile

### Music

- discovering tracks absolutetly randomly
- discovering tracks through genres
- ability to look through the site with music playing in the background
- looking through other people's playlists
- getting served a random person's playlist

Additionally, I plan on cooperating with a backend developer to properly retrieve access tokens from Spotify.
